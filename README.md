# Workspace Organization

All files for the project will be stored in the Github repository cs3450group2. Documentation, including the project plan, definition of requirements, and use case diagrams, are to be included in the /docs/ folder in this repository.

# Version control procedures

To keep track of work done on issues, this repository creates issue branches for each issue opened in Github. Pull requests are reviewed by at least one other member of the team before being merged into the main branch to avoid merging bad code.

# Tool stack description and setup procedure

Django is a convenient framework for this app since it comes with a simple SQLite database. This app will be using database features to manage many different types of data making SQLite very useful. Django also uses the Python language which will help with team functionality since we all know the language.
